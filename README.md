# Active Directory User Management and Security Lab

The objective of this lab is to get familiar with Active Directory capabilities for User management, group policy, and security management.

In this lab we will create Organizational Units, Groups, and Users. Configure Group Policy to disable USB access and Removable Storage Access, and a group policy for a password policy and account lockout policy. 

Please note this lab builds off of an already created Windows Server 2022 VM with Active Directory installed!

Let's get started!


## Creating Organizational Units, Groups, and Users

Let's start off by creating new Organizational Units or OUs for short.

- Organizational Units are containers used to organize and structure objects within Active Directory, such as users, groups, and computers. OUs help administrators manage policies and permissions efficiently by grouping related objects under one unit.
